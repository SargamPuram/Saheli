## What is PCOS?

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders among women of reproductive age. It affects millions of women worldwide and can lead to irregular periods, difficulty getting pregnant, and other health issues. Unfortunately, many women remain undiagnosed or struggle to manage the condition effectively, making it essential to spread awareness and offer better solutions.

## How PCOS Affects Women

PCOS can manifest in several ways, and its symptoms can vary from person to person. Common symptoms include:

- **Irregular periods** or no periods at all
- **Excess androgen (male hormone)** levels, leading to symptoms like acne, facial hair growth, and male-pattern baldness
- **Weight gain** or difficulty losing weight
- **Ovulation problems**, making it harder to get pregnant
- **Skin problems**, such as oily skin or acanthosis nigricans (dark, velvety patches of skin on the back of the neck, armpits, or groin)
- **Sleep apnea**
- **Mood swings** and depression
